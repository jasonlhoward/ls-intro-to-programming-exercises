What does each method return in the following example?

arr = [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1]

1. arr.index(5)
>>> 3

2. arr.index[5]
I think will generate an error because index does not have a [] nethod
It does :)
NoMethodError: undefined method `[]' for #<Enumerator: [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1]:index>
	from (irb):14
	from /usr/bin/irb:11:in `<main>'

3. arr[5]
>>> 8
