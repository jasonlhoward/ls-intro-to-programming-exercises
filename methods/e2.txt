1. x = 2

Would return 2 and there would be nothing printed to the screen

2. puts x = 2

Would return nil and 2 is printed to the screen

3. p name = "Joe"

Would return "Joe" and "Joe" is printed to the screen. Interesting,
this is very similar to the previous scenario but a value
is returned

4. four = "four"

Would return "four" and nothing would be printed to the screen

5. print something = "nothing"

Would return "nil" and nothing is printed to the screen
