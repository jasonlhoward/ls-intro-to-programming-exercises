x = 0
3.times do
  x += 1
end
puts x

Will print 3.
The do/end following 3.times is a block. It's a block because
3.times is a method. Because the x was declared outside the block,
the block has access to this variable and can change it's value.

y = 0
3.times do
  y += 1
  x = y
end
puts x

Will generate an error. 
The scope of x is local to the block immediately following the 
3.times method. After the method returns and passes control back 
to main, the x variable is no longer in scope.

The actual error generated:
e5.rb:6:in `<main>': undefined local variable or method `x' for main:Object (NameError)
